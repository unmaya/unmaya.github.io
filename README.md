Comfy Pixel [Site](http://comfypixel.com)
===========================

This is the source code for comfypixel.com - Its a Jekyll site where we experiment with design, code and to house other personal projects. Consider it our little Web lab.

Comfy Pixel is a collaboration between two curious designers: [Fred](http://fredmaya.com) & [Lisa](http://lisamaya.com)
