Comfy Pixel [Site](http://comfypixel.com)
===========================

This is the source code for comfypixel.com - Its a Jekyll site where I experiment with design, code and house other personal projects. Consider it my little Web lab.

## Components used:
* Girder Sass Grid [Project Page](http://comfypixel.com/Girder)
* Breakpoint Compass [Source](https://github.com/team-sass/breakpoint)
* FitText JS [Project Page](http://fittextjs.com/)

Comfy Pixel operates as a partnership between two inquisitive minds: [Fred](http://fredmaya.com) & [Lisa](http://lisamaya.com)
